Architecture of diverse unified colorization network. The network consists of two sub-nets: (a) a Chroma-VQGAN to disentangle and quantize chroma representation from the continuous gray one, and (b) a Hybrid-Transformer to generate diverse colorization results from unified conditions and continuous gray features.
