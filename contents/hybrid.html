<p>Colorization on legacy old photos with hybrid controls. In each row, we first show the input grayscale photo, followed by four design cases under different hybrid conditions. We indicate stroke-based conditions with blue boundaries, exemplar-based conditions with green boundaries, and text-based conditions with orange boundaries.</p>
